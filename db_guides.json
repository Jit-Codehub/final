Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor the growth and development of the baby during this period to avoid any complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on to know about FGR, its causes, symptoms, treatment, and preventive measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{{toc|safe}}</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"different-types-of-iugrs-during-pregnancy\"><strong>Different types of IUGRs during pregnancy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main types of intrauterine growth restrictions occurring during pregnancy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Symmetrical or primary IUGR</strong>:<strong> The baby has a symmetrical body in proportion with the internal organs, but is smaller than the size of a normal baby of that age</strong>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Asymmetrical or secondary IUGR:</strong> The baby has a normal head and brain but a smaller body than what it should be at that gestational age. This condition is not evident until the third trimester.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"reasons-for-restricted-growth-of-fetus-during-pregnancy\"><strong>Reasons For Restricted Growth Of Fetus During Pregnancy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The causes of IUGR are segregated into three broad categories: maternal, fetal and placental<sup>i</sup> (<a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2614&amp;context=theses\">1</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Maternal health is important for the baby to get all the essential nutrients for its growth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fetal health is necessary to make sure the baby receives the nutrients supplied by the mother.</li>\r\n\t<li>The placenta should be healthy enough to carry the nutrients from the mother to the fetus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All the factors mentioned below fall into one of the three categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Pregnancy-induced hypertension:</strong><strong>During pregnancy, your blood pressure is constantly monitored to check for hypertension</strong>. An increased blood pressure may indicate hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension preeclampsia). The flow of blood to the placenta is reduced, cutting down on the supply of sufficient oxygen and supplements to the fetus, thereby leading to slow fetal growth (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834367/\">2</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<img src=\"/media/ck_editor/2023/05/01/a-heathy-diet-can-help-prevent-iugrjpg.webp\" /><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Multiple pregnancies:</strong> In some cases of multiple pregnancies, the slow fetal development is because of the inefficiency of the placenta to meet the nutritional demands of the multiple babies. Moreover, the chances of hypertensive disorder are also high in multiple pregnancies. IUGR occurs in 25-30% of twin pregnancies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018970/\">3</a>).<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Infections:</strong><strong>Any infections transferred from the mother during pregnancy can lead to slow fetal growth.</strong> Infections such as syphilis (a sexually transmitted bacterial infection), toxoplasmosis (a parasitic infection transmitted mainly through under-cooked meat), cytomegalovirus (viral infection with significant impact during pregnancy due to weaker immunity), and rubella (German measles) increase the chances of IUGR (<a href=\"https://www.magicfoundation.org/downloads/IntrauterineGrowthpdf819.pdf\">4</a>).</li>\r\n</ol>", "toc": "<div class=\"card toc\">\r\n<div class=\"card-header\">In This Article</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"card-body\">\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#different-types-of-iugrs-during-pregnancy\">Different types of IUGRs during pregnancy</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#reasons-for-restricted-growth-of-fetus-during-pregnancy\">Reasons For Restricted Growth Of Fetus During Pregnancy</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "featured_image": "", "category": "Pregnancy", "publisher": 5, "created_by": 2, "reviewed_by": 3, "reviewed_at": "2023-04-21T05:04:04Z", "auto_gen_toc": false, "status": "published", "category_slug": "pregnancy", "created_at": "2023-04-19T06:29:12.118Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T12:43:06.495Z"}}, {"model": "guides.blog", "pk": 4, "fields": {"meta_title": "48 Wonderful Names For December Borns", "meta_desc": "48 Wonderful Names For December Borns", "url_slug": "december-baby-names", "content": "<p>Meaningful winter-inspired names add charm to your baby&#39;s personality.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/ck_editor/2023/05/02/48-wonderful-names-for-december-borns-624x702jpg.webp\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re expecting a baby this month, the delight and excitement will only grow.
